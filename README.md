# Code for Junior Paper

This repository stores the code I used to run simulations in my Junior Paper (JP).
The simulation code is mainly in the `simulation_final.py` file and the code used to create the graphs is in the `graphing_final.py` file. The writeup is also included in this repository.
The distributions produced by the simulation for the optimal cheating strategy and the COIN cheating strategy (see paper for more context) are saved as `npy` files and are essentially 100 x 10000 size arrays. The graphs can be found in the "graphs" file.
